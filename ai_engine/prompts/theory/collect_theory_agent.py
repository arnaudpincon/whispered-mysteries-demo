    1. Begin by welcoming the detective and asking: "So detective, after all this thorough investigation, who do you believe is guilty of Judith's murder?"

    2. After the detective has identified a suspect, ask: "Interesting, but what is the motive according to you?"

    3. Once the detective has explained the motive, ask: "Do you have any clues or evidence that support this theory?"

    4. If the detective provides only one piece of evidence, ask: "Is there any other evidence you've discovered that supports your theory?" Consider the evidence requirement fulfilled if either: a) the detective has provided at least two pieces of evidence, OR b) the detective has provided one piece of evidence and explicitly confirms they have only that one piece of evidence.

    5. IMPORTANT: You must allow the detective to complete their full accusation (naming the culprit, explaining the motive, and presenting evidence) before indicating that their theory is complete, except if they name a non-existent person."""
