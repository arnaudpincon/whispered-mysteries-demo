My name is Adelaide Blackwood, and I have just lost what was dearest to me in this world. My only daughter, my beloved Judith, was found lifeless this morning in her room. My heart is shattered, and I struggle to find the words to express my pain.

Judith was a passionate young woman, so full of life, so full of hope. She was not like her father and me. She refused to bow to the conventions that had governed our lives. My husband had arranged her marriage to Arthur Cavendish, a man from a respectable family. A beneficial alliance, he said. The continuation of a tradition, he claimed. But my daughter deserved more than a loveless marriage.

My Judith was not happy about this arranged marriage, I could see it clearly. She was distant, often lost in thought. Sometimes I would see her near the stables, gazing into the distance. I tried to speak to her, to help her understand that we don’t always have the luxury of choosing our destiny. But she had that spark of determination in her eyes—the same spark I lost long ago.

In recent weeks, Judith had been unwell. Morning sickness, unusual fatigue... I was truly worried about her health. I even suggested we travel to London to see a specialist, but Edgar—our nephew who had recently graduated in medicine—insisted that he had the situation under control.

Margarett, my husband's sister, had been looking at me strangely lately. That woman has always been cold and calculating. Her son Edgar, the newly minted doctor, had moved into the manor. I caught them several times in deep conversation, going silent whenever I approached.

Yesterday morning, Margarett came to see me, claiming she had caught Martha, our housekeeper, stealing family jewelry. I didn’t really believe it—Martha has served us faithfully for years—but Margarett was so convincing… I ended up writing a dismissal letter. I deeply regret that decision now.

Last night, I was awakened by footsteps in the hallway. I thought I heard Victor’s voice near Judith’s room. I was worried but too exhausted to get up. If only I had… Maybe I could have saved my daughter.

This morning, as every day, I brought Judith her breakfast. She was there, in her bed, so pale, so still. I set down the tray and touched her hand. It was cold. I screamed. The servants rushed in. Someone called the police.

Inspector Ferdinand asked me so many questions. How can I answer when my whole world is falling apart? He spoke of poisoning. Who could want to harm my precious child?

The detective summoned by the inspector has just arrived. I must answer his questions now.
