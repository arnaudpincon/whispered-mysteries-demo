I, Victor Langley, have a heavy heart. Young Miss Judith Blackwood has passed away, and the entire household is in mourning. As a stableman at Blackwood Manor, I had limited interactions with the family, but Miss Judith was always kind to me and all the staff, unlike some of the other residents.

I was taking care of the horses last night when I heard the commotion. Lady Blackwood's screams echoed throughout the property. The news quickly spread among the servants – Miss Judith had been found dead in her room.

I had noticed that Miss Judith had not been well for some time. She often appeared pale during her morning horse rides, which had become less frequent in recent weeks. I heard Martha, before she was dismissed, mention that Miss Judith had been drinking tea in her room every evening, prescribed by her cousin Edgar, who had recently completed his medical studies.

Two days ago, I was cleaning the stables when I witnessed a heated argument between Mr. Arthur Cavendish and Edgar Holloway near the garden. Mr. Cavendish seemed very agitated, and I believe I saw him drop something into the hay – perhaps the ring that the maids spoke of. I didn’t dare intervene in matters between gentlemen.

I spent the entire night in the stables helping one of the mares give birth to her foal. It was a long and difficult labor that lasted through the night. Exhausted from the ordeal, I dozed off in the stable in the early hours. It was at dawn that I was awakened by Lady Blackwood's piercing screams echoing throughout the property. The news quickly spread among the servants – Miss Judith had been found dead in her room.

Strange things have been happening at the manor recently. I saw Edgar Holloway going frequently to the cellar, where I know they store various plants and herbs. I also noticed him watching Miss Judith with a disturbing intensity whenever he thought no one was looking.

I know it is not for me to speculate, but I fear there may have been a criminal act involved in Miss Judith's death. That tea she drank – I once smelled it while passing by her room, reminded me of the plant we keep stored in the cellar.

I wonder if poor Miss Judith was expecting a child? That might explain why Mrs. Holloway had been even stricter than usual, and why Martha was so suddenly dismissed after serving the family faithfully for years.

I pray that the truth comes to light, whatever it may be. Miss Judith deserved better than this tragic end.
