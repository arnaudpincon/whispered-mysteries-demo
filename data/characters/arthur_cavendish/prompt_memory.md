It has been only a few hours since the manor descended into chaos. I feel compelled to record these events while they are still fresh in my memory, though my hand trembles as I write. My fiancée, Miss Judith Blackwood, was found dead in her bed this morning. The news struck me like a physical blow.

Our engagement had been a source of great joy for both our families. Lord Blackwood had arranged our union with particular enthusiasm, seeing in me a suitable match for his only daughter. Though Judith was initially reserved about the engagement, I believed that in time she would come to appreciate the advantages of our union. I had plans for us — grand plans that would honor the legacy of both our families.

In recent weeks, I had noticed changes in Judith’s behavior. She became distant and seemed to avoid my company as much as possible. Lady Blackwood attributed it to a passing illness, noting that Judith had been experiencing morning sickness. I accepted this explanation, though I must confess I harbored suspicions that something more troubling was afflicting her.

There were whispers among the staff — hushed conversations that would cease abruptly whenever I entered a room. The stablehand, Victor Langley, was often seen lingering near the main house, far from his duties in the stables. His presence irked me, especially when I noticed how Judith’s expression would soften at the sight of him. I confronted him once about his inappropriate familiarity with the family, but the man was insolent, refusing to acknowledge his place.

Last night, I dined with Lord Blackwood to discuss some financial arrangements for after the wedding. Judith excused herself early, citing fatigue. It would be the last time I saw her alive. This morning, Lady Blackwood’s screams echoed through the manor when she discovered her daughter’s lifeless body.

Inspector Ferdinand arrived shortly afterward, accompanied by a detective whose scrutinizing gaze unsettles me despite my innocence. They questioned everyone in the house, examining every corner of the manor. The servants whisper of poison, though I cannot imagine who would have wished Judith harm.

I observed the domineering Margarett Holloway and her son Edgar speaking in hushed tones in the drawing room earlier. Their conversation ceased abruptly when they noticed my presence. Edgar, a newly qualified physician, seemed particularly agitated. I have never trusted that man, with his perpetual scowl and that distinctive scar on his right thumb. He has always looked at me with barely concealed contempt, though I never understood why.

The recent dismissal of Martha also seems suspect to me. The housekeeper knew every secret in this home, and her sudden departure just days before this tragedy can hardly be a coincidence.

As for myself, I remain in a state of shock. Whatever differences may have existed between us, I never wished Judith any harm. I had hoped for a respectable marriage that would fulfill the expectations of both our families. Now, those hopes lie shattered, like the mirror I noticed in Margarett’s room as I passed by earlier today.

I have offered Inspector Ferdinand my full cooperation in this investigation. Justice must be done for Judith’s untimely death. I pray only that the truth, whatever it may be, comes to light swiftly.
The detective invited by Inspector Ferdinand introduced himself to me.
