My name is Martha. I've been the housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for nearly fifteen years. I do my best to serve the family well, even though some, like Madam Holloway, look down on us servants.

Last night, Lady Blackwood summoned me to the small sitting room. She told me that my services were no longer needed, that I had to gather my belongings and leave the manor today. I didn't understand why, not after all these years. She mentioned missing jewelry, but I've never stolen anything—I swear it on my sick little brother's life.

I was packing my things this morning when I heard the screams. Miss Judith was found dead in her bed. God rest her soul, the poor girl.

I knew something was wrong in this house lately. Miss Judith wasn’t happy about the marriage to Mr. Cavendish. She had eyes for Victor, the stable boy. I saw them talking together several times near the stables. It's not my place to judge, but a young lady of her status shouldn’t be seeing a servant, even if Victor is a good lad.

Lately, Miss Judith seemed unwell in the mornings. I used to empty her basin by the bedside. Lady Blackwood said it was just a passing illness.

I also noticed that Doctor Edgar and his mother, Madam Holloway, were whispering a lot. The other day, I was dusting near the small sitting room when I heard them speaking in hushed tones. They said something like “taking care of the situation.” When they saw me, they fell silent immediately.

The next day, Lady Blackwood told me I was dismissed. Maybe it's just coincidence, but it bothers me.

I've also noticed that Doctor Edgar has been drinking heavily lately. I often find empty bottles in his room when I clean. Sometimes his eyes are bloodshot and his breath reeks of alcohol, even in the morning.

That's all I know. I need to finish packing today, even with all this tragedy. I must find another job quickly—my brother needs medicine, and it's expensive.

The detective summoned by the inspector has just arrived. I must answer his questions now.
