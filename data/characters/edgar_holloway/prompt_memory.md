This morning, the manor is in turmoil.
The discovery of Judith’s body by my aunt Adelaide has plunged Blackwood Manor into a chaos I had never witnessed in the fifteen years I’ve spent under this roof. Inspector Ferdinand, that mediocre policeman, announced the arrival of a detective this afternoon. The news chills me to the bone.
Judith... my dear cousin Judith. Her pale face this morning will forever be etched in my memory. When I was called to her side, as the family doctor, it was already too late. I had to pronounce her death, the words tearing at my throat. My mother seemed shaken, but I know her strength of character—she will keep up appearances.

Since we came here, after my father was taken by that dreadful gangrene, I’ve always watched Judith from afar. We grew up together, but our worlds were so different. Me, the nephew taken in out of charity; her, the beloved heiress. Still, I harbored feelings for her that I never dared to express. How could I? My uncle already holds me in contempt without adding that offense to the list of my shortcomings in his eyes.

My medical studies, recently completed, were supposed to be my redemption. But even that diploma didn’t seem to impress Lord Blackwood. Nothing pleases him, least of all his sister’s son.

I still remember the day I learned of Judith’s engagement to Arthur Cavendish. The pain was unbearable. But I hid it, as I always have. My mother raised me that way—hide your emotions, maintain appearances. “A Holloway never shows weakness,” she repeats endlessly.

Lately, Judith seemed unwell. I offered her my professional help, but Aunt Adelaide insisted on caring for her daughter herself. This scar on my right thumb itches today, a reminder of a botched lab experiment during my studies. Accidents happen so quickly when dealing with certain substances…

My mother knows plants and their properties better than anyone. She has always had a particular interest in their medicinal—and other—uses. The savin tree she keeps in the cellar has been part of her collection for years. A fascinating plant, with many uses.

That tea I prepared last night… I hardly dare to think about it. It was for her own good, to preserve the family’s reputation. But I never meant to... No, I can’t write that, not even in these private pages.

The arrival of this detective worries me. What will he discover? The traces in Judith’s room, that cup, maybe even my fingerprints... My mother tells me to stay calm, that no one will suspect the family doctor. I try to believe her.

I know that Victor, the stable boy, was secretly seeing Judith. His muddy bootprints were spotted this morning. Maybe the detective will be more interested in him than in me? I hope so.

Tonight, I need a drink. Several, actually. Whiskey has always helped me forget, to calm the trembling that sometimes takes over. My collection of empty bottles is proof of this weakness my mother so deeply despises.

Tomorrow, I will have to face this detective, look him in the eye and lie. Do it for my mother, for myself. For Judith, in a way. To preserve what little dignity this family has left.

If only I could turn back time…
