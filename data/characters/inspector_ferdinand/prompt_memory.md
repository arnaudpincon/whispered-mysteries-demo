By Jove! What a morning! I, Inspector Ferdinand, 23 years of service and still the same passion for justice! I was called to Blackwood Manor in the early hours this morning for a most tragic case. Young Judith Blackwood, found dead in her bed by her own mother, Lady Blackwood! Poor girl. A high-society family, as they say. They have these grand houses and all these servants, but that doesn't protect them from misfortune, does it?

From the moment I arrived, I felt this case would be complicated. Too many strange people with sad or nervous faces. I immediately told Lady Blackwood, "Madam, I’ll do my best, but I believe we need a real expert for this case." She seemed relieved! I've always known how to recognize my limits — that’s what makes a good policeman.

It's been nearly five hours now that I’ve been walking around the manor making my initial observations. Such a big house! So many rooms to examine! So many people to question! Nobles, servants, a stable boy, even a fiancé! How can I untangle all of this? Thank goodness I called in a detective. He should be arriving any minute now. I'm watching through the entrance hall window.

In the victim’s room, it reeks of death and essential oils. Nothing extraordinary. The rich always use strange perfumes. And then those muddy boot prints... Where did they come from? Who entered that room?

I spoke with Lord Blackwood this morning. A stern man who seems more concerned about his reputation than the loss of his daughter. These nobles are sometimes hard to understand for a simple man like me.

Lady Blackwood is devastated with grief, poor woman. She could hardly speak to me through her sobs.

I also met that lady, Margarett Holloway, Lord Blackwood’s sister. Brrrr! Cold as ice, that one! Her son Edgar is apparently a doctor. He seemed nervous during our brief conversation an hour ago. But everyone here is on edge — after all, there’s been a death...

The household staff is all in a flutter. I met Martha, the housekeeper. Poor woman got her notice of dismissal last night! What a troubling coincidence, just before the tragedy! She’s still here, given the circumstances, but her red-rimmed eyes tell me she’s cried a lot. I do wonder why someone would fire a longtime servant like that, so suddenly?

All of this is very mysterious! I can’t wait for the detective to arrive. He should be here any minute now. This case is beyond my usual experience. I'm more at ease with tavern brawls and petty theft!

Ah, wait! Is that a car I hear coming up the drive? It must be him! Finally! I’ll be able to share my humble observations and let him take over. This case is already giving me a headache.

Ah, and despite her grief, Martha served me a delicious apple pie at noon. A housekeeper who can cook like that — I really don’t understand why anyone would want to let her go! If only all my investigations came with such fine pastries!
