      "condition": "Burnt journal page",
      "secret": "*frowns, adjusts his glasses* Hmm, a burned page? *examines clumsily* M... M... could it be Martha? Or Lord Blackwood himself, his name is Maximilian? *scratches his head* Hard to say with so few words. *shrugs* This kind of scribble could mean anything, frankly. People in grand houses often write strange things. *hands you back the paper* Keep looking, my friend. The truly important clues are generally more... obvious."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Dismissal letter",
      "secret": "Ah, the housekeeper's dismissal! *nods importantly* I've heard about that. A matter of stolen jewelry, isn't it? *thoughtful* Curious timing, just before Miss Blackwood's death... *adjusts his tie* But domestic affairs are rarely linked to more serious crimes. *confident* This Martha probably left the house well before the murder. I doubt she's involved. Servants generally don't attack their masters. They know they're the first suspects!"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Scented tea box",
      "secret": "*sniffs the box* Tea? *sneezes loudly* Excuse me. *wipes his nose* The violet scent is pretty, but I personally prefer a good coffee. *looks at you seriously* You think the tea is important in this case? *skeptical* Tea poisonings are a bit... novelistic, aren't they? *nervous laugh* But note it if you want. One must be methodical, even with details that seem insignificant."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Lord Blackwood's will",
      "secret": "*adjusts his glasses, reads slowly* Hmm, I see. *important air* So the manor was to go only to Judith's children, not to her husband. *nods* That's classic in these wealthy families. Always complicated inheritance stories. *looks at you* A potential motive? Perhaps... but who benefits from Judith's death without children? *thinks then gives up* These succession matters are too complex for me. That's why I hired you, after all!"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Hidden message",
      "secret": "*reads the message* 'J'... Judith, I suppose. *frowns* 'Important news'? *shrugs* Young women often find important things that aren't really important. A new dress, perhaps? *thoughtful* Or something concerning her upcoming marriage? *looks at you* Unless... *lowers his voice* No, I shouldn't speculate. Keep looking, you might find who this message was intended for."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Ring with initials",
      "secret": "*examines the ring* AC... Arthur Cavendish, without a doubt. *surprised* In the stables? Strange place to lose such a precious signet ring. *knowing look* A gentleman like him doesn't often frequent the stables, I imagine. *thinks* Perhaps he lost it while inspecting a horse? *shrugs* Or perhaps there's another explanation. Personal objects found in unexpected places are often revealing, my friend!"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Signs of struggle",
      "secret": "A fight in the stables? *interested* Now that's more concrete! *becomes animated* Signs of a struggle, you say? *rubs his chin* And with Mr. Cavendish's ring found there... *laborious thinking* There could be a connection. *proud of his deduction* Excellent discovery! We should question the stable hands. These people usually know everything that happens on a property. *whispers* They have eyes and ears everywhere, believe me."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Muddy boot prints",
      "secret": "*barely looks* Muddy boots in a stable? *laughs* My dear friend, that's like finding water in a river! *shakes his head* I understand your attention to detail, but some elements are simply... normal. *pats your shoulder* Don't waste too much time on this. Focus instead on truly unusual clues. *confident* That's what will solve our case!"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Small firearm",
      "secret": "*startles* Good heavens! A firearm! *looks at it cautiously* And it belongs to Lady Blackwood? *very surprised* That's unexpected. A woman of her rank... *examines the weapon* It doesn't seem to have been used recently. *looks at you* But why did she possess one? *thoughtful* Fear is often revealing... Lady Blackwood perhaps felt threatened? *excited* This is a very interesting clue, very interesting indeed!"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Message signed V",
      "secret": "*reads carefully* 'V'... *thinks* Victor, the stable hand? *surprised* A meeting in the attic with someone? *scandalized* That would be extremely inappropriate! *adjusts his collar* A servant arranging private meetings with the daughter of the house... *nods gravely* This certainly deserves further investigation. *whispers* Forbidden passions often lead to tragedies, my friend."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Basin",
      "secret": "*examines the basin* For being sick, I suppose? *grimaces* Miss Judith was ill? *nods* It's a detail worth noting, of course, but... *hesitant* I don't quite see how it relates to her death. *thinks* Unless she was being poisoned gradually? *shakes his head* No, that's unlikely. Poisoners generally act more quickly. *shrugs* Note it anyway. You never know."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Scented tea cup",
      "secret": "*examines the cup more attentively* A fingerprint with a crescent scar? *sniffs* And that particular smell... *suddenly more serious* This could be important. *thinks* Do you know anyone in the house with such a scar? *thoughtful* As for this smell... it reminds me of certain medicinal plants. Or toxic ones. *looks at you* You should have this cup analyzed. *lowers his voice* I'm beginning to think Miss Blackwood may have been poisoned."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Fresh muddy boot prints",
      "secret": "*exclaims* Ah! Now that's concrete! *excited* Boot tracks in the room of a young woman of good family! *nods vigorously* That's very unusual, very revealing! *examines the tracks* They seem fresh... from the night of the incident, perhaps? *triumphant air* Someone wearing work boots entered her room! *looks at you intensely* Victor, the stable hand? The one from the message signed 'V'? *rubs his hands* We're making progress, my friend, we're making progress!"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Empty alcohol bottles",
      "secret": "*shrugs* Empty bottles? *unimpressed* Young men drink, it's in their nature. *detached air* Mr. Edgar likes alcohol, so be it. It's hardly a crime. *thinks* Unless... the alcohol altered his judgment? *scratches his chin* A drunk man may commit acts he would regret when sober. *hesitant* But it's a very thin lead. I don't quite see the connection to our case."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Edgar's personal journal",
      "secret": "*eyes widened* Edgar in love with his cousin? *shocked* That is... inappropriate. *thinks* But a potential motive, certainly! *becomes animated* Jealousy is one of the most powerful motives for crime, right after money. *thoughtful* If Edgar couldn't bear to see Judith married to another... *nods* And with those alcohol bottles in his room... *looks at you* We'll need to question him very carefully. Very carefully, indeed."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Laboratory equipment",
      "secret": "*adjusts his glasses* Laboratory equipment, you say? *intrigued* And he studies medicine? *thinks* That means he would have knowledge of chemistry, of... toxicology perhaps? *suddenly animated* With access to potentially dangerous substances? *stares at you* And if we connect this to the strange tea cup... *whispers* You know, my friend, I'm beginning to see a picture forming. And it's not favorable to Mr. Edgar."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Broken mirror",
      "secret": "*raises eyebrows* A broken mirror and blood? *thoughtful* Anger, perhaps? Or grief? *hesitant* Mrs. Holloway seems to have had a... violent reaction. *thinks* Was it simply the pain of losing her niece? *dubious* Women can be emotional, certainly, but... *frowns* Why such rage? *looks at you* There may be more to discover about Mrs. Holloway and her relationship with Judith. Or perhaps it's unimportant."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Arthur's father's letter",
      "secret": "*reads slowly* Ah, I see. *knowing look* The Cavendishes coveted the property. *nods* That's often the case in these arranged marriages. *thinks* Does this give Arthur a motive? *hesitant* But why kill his fiancée before the wedding? It doesn't make sense. *perplexed* Unless he discovered something that compromised their union? *looks at you* Or perhaps it's related to the will you found? *sighs* These family matters are so complicated..."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Wet handkerchiefs",
      "secret": "*indifferent air* Wet handkerchiefs? *unimpressed* Someone cried, so what? *shrugs* In a house where a death has just occurred, tears are predictable. *thinks* Martha, perhaps, before her departure? *looks at you* I don't see how this advances our case, frankly. *pats your shoulder* But note it if you think it's important. Your instinct has already proven... occasionally right."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Medical letter",
      "secret": "*examines the letter* Martha's brother is sick? *thoughtful* And she needed money for his care... *thinks* That could explain why she would have stolen, if she did. *shrugs* But what connection with Judith's death? *confused* Martha had already been dismissed, hadn't she? *shakes his head* I don't see a direct link to our investigation. *sighs* Sometimes, my friend, a coincidence is just a coincidence."
    },
    {
      "condition": "Locket with photo",
      "secret": "*takes the locket, astonished* Good heavens! *examines the photo* Judith and the stable hand? *very excited* That's an unexpected development! *looks at you triumphantly* A secret affair! *nods vigorously* This changes everything! *connects the clues* The message signed 'V', the boots in her room... *claps his hands* What if Victor entered her room that night? A lovers' quarrel perhaps? *very confident* We may have our culprit, my friend!"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Small shrub",
      "secret": "*steps back slightly* A toxic plant, you say? *sniffs cautiously* That smell... *suddenly alert* It resembles that of the tea cup! *looks at you, amazed* My God, you might be right about poisoning! *thinks intensely* If someone knew the properties of this plant... *thoughtful* A doctor, perhaps? Or someone with knowledge of botany? *becomes animated* I believe we're approaching the truth, my friend. But who would have had access to this plant AND to Judith's room?"
    },
    {
      "condition": "Jewelry box",
      "secret": "*surprised* Wait, you took Lady Blackwood's jewelry box! I suggest you go put them back. *stops at a ring* That one looks nice, I'd offer it to my wife... Ah, but I don't have a wife. Well, go put that back in place. ▬ *sniffs clumsily* Hmm, that's gunpowder! No, wait... it must be chimney soot. Actually, I don't know. Why are you asking me to examine these details?"
