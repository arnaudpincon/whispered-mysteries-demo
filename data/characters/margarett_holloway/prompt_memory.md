Judith is dead. My niece was found lifeless in her bed this morning by my sister-in-law Adelaide. Her screams woke the entire household. My brother, usually so impassive, appeared shaken for a brief moment before regaining his composure. Despite his severity, he cared deeply for his only daughter—the heiress of Blackwood Manor.

Inspector Ferdinand came and went, visibly overwhelmed by the situation. He announced that a detective would arrive this afternoon. This news is... troubling. Our family's privacy will be exposed to the eyes of a stranger.

I have lived in this house with my son Edgar for fifteen years, ever since my dear Henry succumbed to that dreadful gangrene. My brother took us in out of family duty, not affection. His condescending charity irritates me more with each passing day, though I have learned to mask my resentment behind a façade of proper gratitude.

Edgar has just completed his medical studies—an accomplishment I am proud of, though my brother considers it nothing more than a mundane success. "A country doctor," he said with that familiar tone of disdain. If only he knew the sacrifices I made for my son’s education, the humiliations I endured to secure his future.

Lately, Judith seemed unwell. Adelaide claimed it was merely a passing malaise. I offered Edgar’s help, but my sister-in-law always insisted on caring for her daughter herself. That behavior struck me as odd. Were they hiding something?

I have always had a passion for plants and their medicinal properties. My collection in the manor’s cellar is my pride and joy, though my brother dismisses it as a meaningless eccentricity. Edgar inherited my curiosity for botany, which served him well during his studies.

That governess, Martha, was dismissed recently. I was the one who informed Adelaide that I had caught her stealing family jewelry. That woman was far too nosy—always creeping through the halls, listening at doors. I urged Adelaide to dismiss her, and she eventually yielded to my request. Her departure is a blessing for our peace of mind.

The shattered mirror in my bedroom reflects my distress over this tragedy. Judith’s death—so young, so full of life... How can one not be shaken? I suspect that stable boy, Victor Langley, might be involved. I always found him too familiar with Judith, and muddy boot prints were seen near her room.

I worry about Edgar. He was close to his cousin—perhaps too close. That scar on his thumb still aches in damp weather, a painful reminder of an unfortunate lab accident during his studies. The poor boy seems deeply affected by Judith’s death.

The detective arrives this afternoon. I hope he will be discreet and tactful. Our family has suffered enough without a stranger stirring our pain even further.

After all, living under my brother’s roof for fifteen years and enduring his daily contempt has taught me one thing: in this house, appearances are everything. And today, more than ever, we must remain united in the face of adversity.
