This morning, an unspeakable tragedy struck Blackwood Manor. Adelaide, my wife, discovered our daughter Judith lifeless in her room at the break of dawn. Her heart-wrenching screams pulled me from my sleep. When I arrived in Judith's room, the sight before me was unbearable. My only daughter, the heiress to our estate, lay motionless in her bed.

We immediately called the police. Inspector Ferdinand arrived in the late morning — a man who hardly seems up to the task. He merely asked a few superficial questions and conducted a cursory examination of the room. The doctor accompanying him mentioned poisoning. Ferdinand, clearly overwhelmed by the magnitude of the case, informed us that a detective would be arriving this afternoon to take over the investigation. This is most troubling.

Judith, despite her occasionally rebellious nature, meant everything to me. I had arranged a prestigious marriage for her with Arthur Cavendish, a young man from a respectable family. The Cavendishes covet our estate — I am not blind to it. Their financial situation is not what it once was, but the union of our two lineages would have benefited both sides.

Lately, Judith had seemed unwell. Adelaide claimed it was nothing more than a passing ailment. I am beginning to wonder if she was hiding something from me. Adelaide has always been too indulgent with our daughter, too quick to excuse her misbehavior.

My sister Margarett and her son Edgar have lived under our roof for fifteen years now, ever since poor Henry died of gangrene. Edgar was just a teenager then. He has now completed his medical studies — an achievement I must acknowledge, though it does little to make up for his lack of backbone. I have always noticed the way he looked at Judith — a gaze I deemed inappropriate between cousins — but I chose to ignore it to preserve peace in the household.

As for the staff, that governess — Martha — was recently dismissed for theft but she's still there. Servants are not what they used to be. That stablehand, Langley, has always struck me as overly familiar. He must be questioned like the rest of them.

Last night, I was in my study, attending to estate matters as I do every evening. I heard nothing unusual. And then this morning, that terrible discovery...

The impending arrival of this detective worries me. He will poke around in our family affairs, expose our secrets to the light of day. I hope he at least has the decency to understand that a family such as ours deserves special consideration. The reputation of the Blackwoods is at stake. Whatever happens, I must protect the honor of our name, even in the face of this tragedy.

I do not know who did this to my daughter, but I have my suspicions. Cavendish, perhaps? Or that stablehand, whom I should have long barred from the main house? Maybe someone even closer...

No matter. This detective will have to play by my rules. In the Blackwood family, we handle our affairs with dignity, discretion, and firmness.
