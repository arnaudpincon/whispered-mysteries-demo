## Scenario 2: Edgar Holloway is guilty (Erroneous Conclusion)

Inspector Ferdinand closes his notebook as Edgar Holloway, his back hunched but his gaze strangely relieved, is taken away by the police. His mother, Margarett, stands motionless at the foot of the stairs, her usually composed face now marked with an indecipherable expression.

"A destructive passion," comments the Inspector gravely. "Edgar was obsessed with his cousin since childhood. When he realized she would never be his, that she preferred a mere stable boy... something broke inside him."

The fingerprints on the teacup, his diary filled with tormented thoughts, the empty alcohol bottles in his room â€“ these clues led you to this conclusion, but a doubt persists within you.

"He loved her with an unhealthy love," continues the Inspector, "and that love turned to hate when he discovered her relationship with Victor. The arsenic was his revenge, slow and calculated."

Lord Blackwood stands motionless by the fireplace, his face a stone mask. Lady Blackwood, seated by the window, gazes at the gardens where Judith will never walk again.

Victor Langley, leaning against the back wall, lets a silent tear escape before leaving the room without a word. Margarett watches her son as he is escorted out of the room, her hands clenched on her black dress.

As you pass through the gates of the manor, you can't help but think that something doesn't quite fit in this case. Is the evidence as solid as it appears? Or have you perhaps overlooked a crucial aspect of this dark family history?
