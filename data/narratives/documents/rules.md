### 🔹 TALK

Talk to someone in the same room:

Once you're speaking with a character, continue naturally, just like in a real conversation.  
Examples:

- “Where were you last night?”
- “Who lives in this house?”
- “What do you know about Judith?”
- “Did you notice anything suspicious?”

💡 **Presenting a clue:**  
If you’ve found an item or clue, you can show it to a character to see how they react:

> “I found this firearm in your belongings. What can you tell me about it?”  
> “Does this handkerchief belong to you? I found it in the garden.”

🗨️❌ **To end a conversation:**  
Simply say something like:  
“Thank you, see you later,” or “I’ll come back later.”

### 🔹 INSPECTION

To carefully examine the current room for hidden or notable details, use:

**INSPECT ROOM**

To inspect or pick up a clue, use:

**TAKE [OBJECT NAME]**  
Examples:  
`TAKE Letter`  
`INSPECT Empty Vial`  
`EXAMINE Shoes`

To check what you’re carrying, use:

**LOOK MY INVENTORY** or **CHECK MY INVENTORY**

### 🔹 CONCLUDE INVESTIGATION

Once you believe you have gathered enough evidence to solve the case, initiate the final phase with:

**CONCLUDE INVESTIGATION**

🔍 **How it works:**

- You will be asked a **series of questions** to build your theory and identify the culprit.  
  Answer **one question at a time, in order** to keep your reasoning clear.
- You have a **maximum of 3 attempts** to solve the case.
- If you fail, you return to exploration mode: continue investigating, asking questions, inspecting rooms, and collecting evidence.
- To submit a new theory, use **CONCLUDE INVESTIGATION** again.
- If you fail three times, the mystery may remain unsolved.

## 🔸 IMPORTANT TIPS

🧠 **The game processes one command at a time.**  
You cannot combine multiple actions in one message.

1. **Explore** the manor and **inspect** rooms
2. **Collect clues** and **present them** to characters
3. **Ask the right questions** to piece together what happened
4. When confident, **formulate your theory** and close the investigation
