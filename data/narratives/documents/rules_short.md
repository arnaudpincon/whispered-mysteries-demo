# 🕵️ Welcome, Detective.

The Blackwood Manor awaits you in the morning mist. Judith Blackwood has been found dead in her bedroom, and you must uncover the truth.

Here's what you can do:

**🚶 MOVEMENT** - Explore with `GO TO [ROOM NAME]` and consult the **MAP** 🗺️ to see available locations.

**🔍 INVESTIGATION** - Search for clues with `INSPECT ROOM`, observe people with `EXAMINE [CHARACTER]`, or examine/collect evidence with `EXAMINE / TAKE [OBJECT]`. Review collected clues in your **BRIEFCASE** 💼.

**💬 CONVERSATION** - Question suspects with `TALK TO [CHARACTER NAME]`. Present evidence during discussions. Use **EXIT CONVERSATION** to return to exploration.

**⚖️ RESOLUTION** - When ready to solve, use the **SOLVE CASE** ⚖️ button. You have 3 attempts to identify the culprit, their motives, and the evidence (minimum 2) that incriminates them.

**☰ MENU** - Change language, tweak game settings, or save/load your progress.

The manor holds secrets in every corner. The inhabitants hide their truths behind forced smiles. Every clue matters, every conversation may reveal a lie. You can be creative in your approach... but mind your reputation. 😏
