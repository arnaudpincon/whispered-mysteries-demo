**MURDER AT BLACKWOOD MANOR**

England, 1891. Your carriage winds through the Surrey countryside, just an hour's ride from London. Inspector Ferdinand has summoned you to Blackwood Manor, one of the grand estates that dot the rolling hills south of the capital, where wealthy families retreat from the city's smoke and noise.

The imposing Victorian manor stands amid manicured grounds, its Gothic towers piercing the autumn mist. Inside the gaslit entrance hall, Inspector Ferdinand awaits, his face etched with concern.
