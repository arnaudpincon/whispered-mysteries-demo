## Scenario 5: Victor Langley is guilty (Erroneous Conclusion)

The evening light bathes the manor in a copper glow as Victor Langley, his hands handcuffed, is led to the police car. His face, once so expressive, is now frozen in an expression of defeat and incomprehension.

"Love and jealousy, the deadliest of mixtures," comments Inspector Ferdinand as he closes his file. "Victor sincerely loved Judith, but when he realized she would be forced to marry Arthur Cavendish, something broke inside him."

The evidence you gathered seems to accuse him: the message signed "V," the muddy boot prints in Judith's room, the locket containing her portrait hidden in the stable.

"He preferred to see her dead rather than married to another," continues the Inspector. "Arsenic was available to treat the horses. He had access to the kitchen and to Judith's remedies. A crime of passion, but methodically executed."

Lady Blackwood, sitting near the window, watches Victor as he casts a desperate last glance at the manor before disappearing into the police vehicle. In her eyes is not the satisfaction of seeing justice done, but a deep doubt.

Arthur Cavendish and Edgar Holloway stand apart, each lost in his thoughts. In the shadows of the room, Margarett Holloway watches the scene, her hands perfectly still on her knees, her face smooth as a porcelain mask.

"I loved her," Victor suddenly cries as he is taken away. "I could never have hurt her. Never!"

His cry echoes in the evening air, and unease settles within you. The clues pointed to him, but was it really the truth? A troubling feeling washes over you, as if a crucial detail had escaped you.

As you leave the grounds, doubt takes hold. Does Blackwood Manor still keep secrets that you have not uncovered?
