## The Events

Judith Blackwood, the only daughter of Lord and Lady Blackwood, was promised in marriage to Arthur Cavendish, a nobleman from a respected lineage. This arranged marriage was to benefit both families - for the Blackwoods, it was a matter of prestige, while for the Cavendishes, it was an opportunity to acquire Blackwood Manor, as clearly revealed in a letter from Arthur's father found in his room.

Lord Blackwood was fully aware of Arthur's and his family's true intentions. In a will kept in his office, he had taken legal measures to ensure that only Judith's children could inherit the manor, thus excluding Arthur from any possibility of seizing the Blackwood fortune.

Judith did not share her father's enthusiasm for this marriage. In secret, she had developed a romantic relationship with Victor Langley, the estate's stable hand. Their love was evidenced by a locket hidden in the attic containing a photo of them together, which Victor accidentally dropped during his last visit.

Despite the difference in social status, their love was sincere. Lady Blackwood was aware of this forbidden relationship between her daughter and the stable hand. She repeatedly tried to convince Judith to end it, fearing the consequences if Lord Blackwood were to find out. However, out of love for her daughter, she kept this secret, refusing to expose her to her husband.

Arthur Cavendish was not indifferent to this situation. During a confrontation with Victor in the stables, a fight broke out, leaving obvious signs of struggle. In his rush to leave the scene, Arthur lost a ring bearing his initials "AC," which was later found in a haystack.

Lady Blackwood, worried for her daughter and fearing that Arthur or someone else might harm her, had procured a small firearm, found among her belongings in the master bedroom. This weapon was intended to protect Judith if necessary, revealing the protective instinct of a mother sensing danger for her child.

Over time, Judith became pregnant by Victor. This news seriously threatened the reputation of the Blackwood family and risked compromising the arranged marriage with Arthur Cavendish. Judith began showing signs of her condition - morning sickness as evidenced by the basin near her bed, obvious symptoms of her pregnancy that Lady Blackwood attributed to a simple illness.

Judith and Victor were planning to run away together to escape social constraints. A hidden message discovered in the library, signed "J," mentioned "important news" to deliver and the urgency to meet quickly. In response to this message, Victor had left a note in Judith's room, inviting her to meet him in the attic that evening so she could reveal this important news to him. Victor was still unaware of Judith's pregnancy, which she was waiting for this meeting to announce that they were going to have a child.

Margarett Holloway, Lord Blackwood's sister and Edgar's mother, discovered Judith's pregnancy. Fearing the scandal that could tarnish the family reputation, she decided to intervene drastically. Her primary intention was to eliminate the unborn child, but not necessarily Judith. She asked her son Edgar, recently graduated in medicine, to help her in this macabre plan.

Martha, the housekeeper who had worked for the family for a long time, was observant and aware of many secrets of the manor. She overheard a crucial conversation between Margarett Holloway and her son Edgar, where they discussed "taking care of the situation."

Margarett, fearing that Martha might reveal what she had heard, manipulated Lady Blackwood by claiming to have caught the housekeeper stealing family jewels. It was a lie, but enough to convince Lady Blackwood to write a dismissal letter, found in the kitchen. Martha was therefore fired without real reason, simply to remove her from the manor and prevent her from disclosing the secrets she knew. The damp handkerchiefs in the servants' quarters testify to her grief following this unjust dismissal, all the more cruel as, as revealed in a medical letter found in her quarters, her little brother was seriously ill and needed money for care.

In the manor's cellar was kept Savin (Juniperus sabina), a plant whose essential oil is extremely toxic, particularly for pregnant women. This plant gives off a strong smell of sap and conifer, identical to that found in Judith's tea cup. Edgar, who regularly consumed alcohol as evidenced by the empty bottles found in his room, was under the influence of his domineering mother. Despite his complex feelings for Judith, whom he was secretly in love with as revealed in the writings in his personal journal found in his room, he prepared a concoction based on Savin oil. The laboratory equipment discovered in his room confirms that he used his medical knowledge to extract active compounds from plants.

They implemented a subtle plan: administer the poison to Judith little by little, over several days, in her daily tea. This gradual dosage was supposed to cause a miscarriage without endangering Judith's life. Edgar, with his medical knowledge, supervised this process, ensuring that the doses remained non-lethal.

However, Margarett grew impatient as Judith and her baby seemed to resist the poison. A torn page from a half-burned journal, found in the main living room fireplace, reveals concerns: "M ..... insists on .......... Her impatience risks ..... . what needs to be done." This note, probably written by Edgar, shows that he was aware of the danger but unable to completely oppose his mother.

On the fateful night, Edgar prepared the usual cup of tea with the dose he considered safe. However, without his knowledge, Margarett excessively increased the amount of poison in the cup, determined to end this pregnancy that threatened the family reputation. Edgar himself brought the cup to Judith, leaving his characteristic fingerprints with the crescent-shaped scar on his thumb, visible on the tea cup found in Judith's room that still emits a strong smell of sap, conifer, and damp wood.

That night, Victor waited for Judith in the attic as agreed in his message. When she did not show up for the meeting, worried, he went down to see her directly in her room. His muddy boots left tracks in the room and on the stairs. It was there that he found Judith dying, suffering from internal bleeding caused by the poison overdose. In his rush and state of shock, he dropped his locket in the attic. Afraid of being accused of what was happening to Judith and helpless in the face of her critical condition, he fled hastily, leaving behind other boot tracks in the stables.

The next morning, Judith was found dead in her bed. The poison overdose had been fatal. Edgar, discovering that his mother had modified the dose, was devastated and consumed with guilt. Margarett herself, who had not wanted to kill Judith but only cause a miscarriage, was overcome with remorse and furiously broke a mirror in her room, the shards of which still testify to her rage and despair.

Lady Blackwood discovered her daughter's body and alerted the police. Inspector Ferdinand was put in charge of the investigation, calling in a detective (the player) to help him solve this delicate case. The cause of death was suspicious, probably poisoning, and all residents of the manor were considered suspects.

Now, it is up to the detective to gather enough evidence to identify the culprit and reveal the truth about the tragic death of Judith Blackwood, exploring every corner of the manor in search of revealing clues, from muddy boot tracks to hidden messages, to that mysterious tea cup bearing Edgar's fingerprint and giving off the characteristic odor of Savin.
