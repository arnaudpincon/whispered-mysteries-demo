# Murder at Blackwood Manor: Conclusions

## Scenario 1: Margarett Holloway is guilty (The True Conclusion)

You watch as Inspector Ferdinand puts away his notes while Margarett Holloway, her face impassive, is escorted out of the manor by two police officers. In the room, silence hangs heavy as lead.

"You've shown remarkable insight," declares the Inspector with admiration. "The evidence is overwhelming. Margarett poisoned her niece with arsenic gradually, increasing the doses when she discovered Judith's pregnancy. A pregnancy that would have caused a scandal and definitively compromised Edgar's chances of inheriting the manor."

Lord Blackwood, seated in his armchair, seems to have aged ten years in just a few hours. Lady Blackwood sobs silently, her trembling hands clutching a lace handkerchief.

"She knew about toxic plants, had access to Judith's food, and above all, she had a powerful motive: securing her son's future by eliminating the obstacle that Judith represented," continues the Inspector. "You were able to see beyond appearances and separate truth from falsehood. Justice will be served thanks to your brilliant investigation."

Through the window, you glimpse Edgar, alone in the garden, his gaze lost. Complicit in his silence or simply a pawn in his mother's cruel game? This question may forever remain unanswered.

Victor Langley leaves the manor without a backward glance, carrying with him the memory of a broken love and dreams that will never come true.

As you prepare to leave, you feel the satisfaction of having discovered the truth. Within these ancient walls, a heinous crime has been solved, and justice will finally be served for Judith.
