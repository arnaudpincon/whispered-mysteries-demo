## Scenario 3: Arthur Cavendish is guilty (Erroneous Conclusion)

The library of Blackwood Manor is plunged into an icy atmosphere as Arthur Cavendish, chin raised in defiance, is escorted outside. His eyes meet yours for a brief moment – a gaze mixing fury and resignation.

"Excessive ambition," summarizes Inspector Ferdinand as he puts away his evidence. "Arthur Cavendish never loved Judith. He coveted only the Blackwood fortune. When he discovered that Lord Blackwood planned to exclude him from the inheritance, he decided to act."

The ring with the AC initials found in the stable, the incriminating letters, his obvious interest in social status rather than Judith – these clues led you to this conclusion, but something seems to be missing.

"He poisoned Judith gradually, calculating his crime to make it look like a natural illness," continues the Inspector. "But criminals, even the most meticulous ones, always leave traces."

Margarett Holloway sits in a corner of the salon, her face as impassive as ever. She carefully arranges the folds of her black dress as the police take Arthur away. Her expression betrays nothing, not even the relief one might expect after the arrest of her niece's murderer.

Lord and Lady Blackwood, sitting side by side for the first time in years, seem united in their grief. Lady Blackwood's gaze lingers on the photograph of her daughter placed on the mantelpiece.

Victor, standing by the window, contemplates the horizon, as if he could glimpse the future he might have had with Judith.

As you leave the manor, rain begins to fall. A troubling feeling washes over you. Was the evidence really as conclusive as it seemed? Do the pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly, or are there still shadows that your investigation has not illuminated?
