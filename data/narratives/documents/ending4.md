## Scenario 4: The Governess (Martha Higgins) is guilty (Erroneous Conclusion)

The manor's drawing room is silent as Martha Higgins, the former governess, is taken away by the police. Her face, usually so composed, is now a mask of resignation. No one would have imagined that behind this facade of devotion lurked such resentment.

"Vengeance is a poison that consumes first the one who carries it," solemnly declares Inspector Ferdinand. "Martha Higgins served this family for decades, only to be dismissed without explanation. Her knowledge of the household habits, her access to Judith's medications, and above all, her termination letter found torn in her quarters â€“ everything seems to accuse her."

Lady Blackwood stifles a sob. The weight of her decision to dismiss Martha now rests heavily on her shoulders.

"She knew every corner of this house, every secret," continues the Inspector. "She could have used arsenic, administered gradually in the herbal teas that Judith took every evening, knowing that the symptoms would resemble those of an illness."

As she is escorted out, Martha meets your gaze with an indecipherable expression. She opens her mouth as if to say something, then thinks better of it, accepting her fate with surprising dignity. Her gaze briefly rests on Margarett Holloway, who observes the scene with unusual rigidity, her fingers gently tapping the armrest of her chair.

Victor Langley, leaning against the back wall, shakes his head in incomprehension. Edgar carefully avoids your gaze, while Lord Blackwood stares fixedly at the portrait of his ancestor above the fireplace.

As you leave the manor, a persistent doubt settles in your mind. The too-perfect Martha, guilty of such a calculated crime? Is the evidence as convincing as it appears? Something about this resolution leaves you unsatisfied, as if an essential piece of the puzzle still eludes you.
