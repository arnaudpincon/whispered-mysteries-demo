# Failed Investigation: The Mystery Persists

The drawing room of Blackwood Manor is silent as Inspector Ferdinand closes his notebook with a sharp gesture. His gaze, fixed on you, is filled with undisguised disappointment. The family members, gathered around the large table, exchange nervous glances.

"I must say," begins the Inspector in a slow and measured voice, "that your conclusions leave much to be desired. The evidence you have gathered is contradictory, your theories lack coherence, and your accusations seem to be based more on assumptions than on tangible facts."

Lord Blackwood straightens in his armchair, his stern gaze moving from the Inspector to you. Lady Blackwood turns her face away, discreetly wiping away a tear. In a corner of the room, Margarett Holloway observes the scene, her face as impassive as ever.

"I had hoped," continues the Inspector as he packs his things, "that your skills would allow us to shed light on this matter. Unfortunately, we have made no progress. The death of Judith Blackwood remains a mystery, and I find myself compelled to restart the investigation from the beginning, without your assistance."

The silence that follows these words is deafening. Victor Langley, in the doorway, shakes his head before disappearing down the hallway. Edgar Holloway carefully avoids your gaze, while Arthur Cavendish displays a barely perceptible smile.

"I thank you for your time," concludes Inspector Ferdinand coldly as he closes his briefcase, "but your services will no longer be required. I would ask you to leave the manor by tomorrow morning. This case requires a more... methodical approach."

As you head toward the door, the feeling of failure grips you. Behind you, the Blackwood family returns to its secrets and lies. Judith's murderer is still among them, free and unpunished.

As you pass through the estate gates, you cast one last glance at the manor silhouetted against the fading evening light. Its dark windows seem to watch you, silent guardians of a truth you failed to unveil.

Somewhere within those walls, a killer breathes more freely tonight, knowing that justice has failed, and that the secrets of Blackwood Manor will remain, for now at least, buried in shadow.
