## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

This is an **experimental game** under active development:

- **AI Responses**: Occasional inconsistencies or unexpected behavior
- **Performance**: May experience delays during AI processing
- **Save System**: Manual save/load only - no automatic progress saving
- **AI Provider**: Azure OpenAI only (Claude, OpenAI API support planned)
- **Language Support**: Partial - AI content only (inventory, menus stay in English)
- **UI**: Optimized for desktop browsers, mobile support limited
- **Stability**: Some edge cases may cause unexpected errors

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Game won't start**:

- Check Azure OpenAI credentials in `.env`
- Verify Python 3.10+ is installed
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**AI responses are slow**:

- Enable caching: `AI_CACHE_ENABLED=true`
- Check network connection to Azure

**Characters not responding**:

- Verify deployment name matches your Azure setup
- Check Azure OpenAI quotas and limits

## 🧩 Game Content

- **17 Rooms**: Full manor to explore
- **7 Characters**: Each with unique personality and secrets
- **15+ Clues**: Evidence to collect and analyze
- **5 Scenarios**: Multiple possible solutions
- **3 Attempts**: Limited chances to solve the case

## 💡 Tips for Players

1. **Talk to everyone**: Each character has valuable information
2. **Explore thoroughly**: Clues are hidden throughout the manor
3. **Take notes**: Remember conversations and evidence
4. **Watch your reputation**: Nonsense actions affect character reactions
5. **Think logically**: Motive, opportunity, and evidence must align
